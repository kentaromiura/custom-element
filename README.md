custom-element
==============

Native declarative way to create a custom webcomponent

Since Polymer shadowdom shim cause problems with mootools I created this clone of the
polymer-element that doesn't use the shadow dom part.

Work in progress. Alpha version. Don't try this at home. No Cats has been harmed during the writing of this clone.
